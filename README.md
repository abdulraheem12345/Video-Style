# Video-Style

The first step in the project involves using the VGG19 network to identify the artistic properties of the given image. These properties can include textures, colors, patterns, and other visual characteristics that define the artistic style. By passing the image through the VGG19 network, we can extract high-level feature representations from different layers of the network.

Once the artistic properties are identified, the next step is to style the videos based on these properties. This is accomplished using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN takes the video frames as input and applies the learned artistic properties to each frame. The CNN can be trained to generate stylized frames that resemble the artistic style of the input image.

The training process for the CNN involves feeding it with pairs of video frames and their corresponding stylized frames. These pairs are generated by applying the artistic style of the image to the original video frames. The CNN learns to map the original frames to their stylized versions, capturing the desired artistic properties in the process.

During training, the CNN optimizes its parameters to minimize the difference between the stylized frames it generates and the ground truth stylized frames. This is typically done using a loss function, such as the mean squared error, which quantifies the dissimilarity between the generated and ground truth frames.

Once the CNN is trained, it can be used to style new videos. The input video frames are passed through the trained network, and the CNN applies the learned artistic properties to each frame, generating stylized frames that resemble the desired artistic style. These stylized frames can then be combined to create a stylized video.

Overall, this project combines the power of pre-trained deep learning models like VGG19 and the flexibility of CNNs to transfer artistic styles from images to videos. It involves identifying artistic properties using VGG19 and training a CNN to generate stylized frames based on those properties, ultimately resulting in a video with the desired artistic style.
